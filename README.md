# cardbot-kibitz
A chatroom bot that allows users to collect custom cards and daily currency.

This bot was made to experiment with the Discord.py API. Users can create accounts and collect randomized cards on a daily and weekly basis, with varying degrees of rarity impacted by the command type. Currency is in "gems", which can be collected on a daily basis and traded in for random cards at given amounts. 

Currently under construction:
- Rerolling three cards in exchange for a single new card
- Trading cards with other users
- In-bot generation of new cards when prompted by Admin
